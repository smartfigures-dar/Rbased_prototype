Adult brain, 10 days (a) +/atg9-RNAi, (b) elav/atg9-RNAi, (d) +/atg5-RNAi, and (e) elav/atg5-RNAi immunostained for p62/Ref(2)p. Scale bar: 50<U+2009><U+00B5>m. c Quantification of p62/Ref(2)p intensity within the central brain region normalized to control (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>15<U+0096>17 independent brains; ***p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001; Mann<U+0096>Whitney U-test). f Quantification of p62/Ref(2)p intensity within the central brain region normalized to control (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>23<U+0096>24 independent brains; ***p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001; Mann<U+0096>Whitney U-test). g Selective autophagy marker p62/Ref(2)p and autophagosome-associated protein Atg8a accumulate in protein homogenate prepared from the brain of elav/atg9-RNA and elav/atg5-RNAi compared to respective controls. An amount equivalent to 1 brain was loaded onto the gel. Lipidated Atg8a (Atg8a-II) is missing upon KD of atg5 but not when atg9 is knocked down. In the box and whisker plots, the middle line of a box represents the median (50th percentile) and the terminal lines of a box represent the 25th and 75th percentile. The whiskers represent the lowest and the highest value"	"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-09262-2"	"Published"	"to_Fill"	"to_Fill"	"to_Fill"	"to_Fill"	"2019-06-07 18:08:55"	"2019"	"Null"	"FALSE"
