In the box and whisker plots, the middle line of a box represents the median (50th percentile) and the terminal lines of a box represent the 25th and 75th percentile. The whiskers represent the lowest and the highest value"	"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-09262-2"	"Published"	"to_Fill"	"to_Fill"	"to_Fill"	"to_Fill"	"2019-06-07 18:18:21"	"2019"	"Null"	"FALSE"
