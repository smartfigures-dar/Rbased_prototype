GFP  was  expressed  using  the  MB driver ok107-Gal4 and vt30559-Gal4, respectively. GFP positive cell bodies were manually  counted  in  random  focal  planes  with  non-overlapping  cells  and  compared  between  genotypes.  No  significant  difference  was  found  between  median  cell  body  counts: +/atg9-RNAi   (1365),   ok107/atg9-RNAi   (1238),   +/atg9-RNAi   (1294)   and   vt30559/atg9-RNAi (1533) (n = 7-17; nsp>0.05, Mann-Whitney U-test).  In the box and whisker plots, the middle line of a box represents the median (50th percentile) and the terminal lines of a box represent the 25th and 75th percentile. The whiskers represent the lowest and the highest value."	"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-09262-2"	"Published"	"to_Fill"	"to_Fill"	"to_Fill"	"to_Fill"	"2019-06-07 18:29:59"	"2019"	"Null"	"FALSE"
