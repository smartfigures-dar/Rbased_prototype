(a) Immunostainings  for  p62/Ref(2)p  in  10d  old  adult  fly  brain  gh146/atg5-RNAi  confirms  buildup  of  p62  aggregates  in  targeted  neuron  populations.  Scale  bar:  50<U+0001D707><U+0001D707><U+0001D707><U+0001D707>.  (b)  Enlarged  image  of  region  of  interest to show the p62 aggregates. Scale bar: 10<U+0001D462><U+0001D462><U+0001D707><U+0001D707>. (c) STM of gh146/atg5-RNAi compared   to   +/atg5-RNAi   (n   =   10-12; nsp>0.5, Mann   Whitney   U-test).   (d)   Immunostainings for p62/Ref(2)p in 10d old adult fly brain gh146/atg9-RNAi confirms buildup  of  p62  aggregates  in  targeted  neuron  populations.

Scale  bar:  10<U+0001D707><U+0001D707><U+0001D707><U+0001D707>. (f)  STM  of  gh146/atg9-RNAi  compared  to  +/atg9-RNAi  (n  =  7-8; nsp>0.5, Mann-Whitney   U-test).   Adult   brain,   10d (g)   +/atg9-RNAi   and   (h)   gh146/atg9-RNAi immunostained  for  BRPNc82.  Scale  bar:  50<U+0001D707><U+0001D707><U+0001D707><U+0001D707>.  (i)  Quantification  of  BRPNc82  intensity within   the   central   brain   region   normalized   to   control   (n   =   6-11   independent   brains; nsp>0.5, Mann-Whitney U-test). In the box and whisker plots, the middle line of  a  box  represents  the  median (50th  percentile)  and  the  terminal  lines  of  a  box  represent  the  25th  and  75th  percentile.  The  whiskers  represent  the  lowest  and  the  highest value."
